    "2. prepare your data: gather and preprocess your data\n",
    "3. define your compute environment: options include AML compute, azure databricks and azure virtual machines\n",
    "4. choose your model type: based on your problem doman and data. it can be a classification, regression, clustering model or any type\n",
    "5. write your training script: it include loading the data, defining the model architecture, training the model and evaluating its perfomance\n",
    "6. create an experiment: they are used to track the training process and results. create an experiment to log metrics, outputs and other relevant information during model training\n",
    "7. Run your script training script: submit your training script to the choosen  compute environment to start training process.\n",
    "8. monitor training progress: you can track metrics, view logs and troubleshoot any issue that may arise.\n",
    "9. evaluate your model: evaluate your model using validation of data or other techniques. model testing makes it easy to deploy and manage your model in production environments.\n",
    "10. Deploy your trained model as a web service or container to make predictions on new data.\n",
    "11. Monitor and maintain your deployed model "
